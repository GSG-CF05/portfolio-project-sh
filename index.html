          <p>
            My name is shatha a software engineering student at AUG in LVL 2. I
            had interested in web development when I was in LVL 1, so I started
            learning coding from different web sites and channels on youtube. I
            learned the fundamental of programming at university with JAVA and C
            languages. also I am a Graphic Designer which I learned it when I was
            in first year.
